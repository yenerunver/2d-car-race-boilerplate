# 2d-car-race-boilerplate
This is a web-based 2D to-view car racing game boilerplate, built with:
- ViteJS
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS

## Get Started
First, install the dependencies:
```shell
yarn
```
Then, to run the game on local environment:
```shell
yarn dev
```

If you would like to enable Redux DevTools, just change the ENV variable (keep in mind that it makes the game extremely slower):
```shell
VITE_DEV_TOOLS=true
```
